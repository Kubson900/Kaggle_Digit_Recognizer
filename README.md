## Thoughts
Most challenging and funniest competition out of which I took part. Computer Vision projects' outputs are easily readable and understandable e.g each digit can be represented as a heatmap matrix or digits can be clustered and distinguished by using Principal Components Analysis which combines features into only 2 mixed features that can be easily plotted.

## Final Model
Support Vector Classifier occurs to be performing the best reaching **0.97521** but still, there is a lot to improve by learning C Neural Networks.
